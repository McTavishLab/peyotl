# peyotl

A python package to make it easier to access web services and data
associated with the [Open Tree of Life project] [1].

This is intended to hold utility code to make it easier to:

1. interact with a local version of the [phylesystem] [2] repository of 
    curated phylogenetic studies ;

2. call web services associated with the studies (served by web app 
    running the [api.opentree.org code] [3]);

3. call web services associated with taxonomic resolution services
    (running [taxomachine] [4] );

4. call web services associated with Open Tree of Life's "synthetic"
    (running [treemachine] [5]);

5. call web services associated with an annotation database (that
     we have not built yet)
