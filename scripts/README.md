This directory has scripts that are thought to be of 
sufficient general interest that they should be installed
when a user runs `python setup.py develop` or `python setup.py install`


## Other scripts using peyotl 
The top-level tutorials directory contains examples of usage of peyotl
which are intended to be fairly stereotyped and 
well documented. See http://opentreeoflife.github.io/peyotl/tutorial/

The top-level examples directory has more scripts that use
peyotl (but are a little quirkier and less likely to demonstrate
peyotl features in an easy step-by-step manner).
