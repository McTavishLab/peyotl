This directory contains the drafts of manuscripts in preparation and the source
for some presentations about peyotl and closely related projects.

If you are looking for documentation on peyotl, see:

We are currently, targetting a manuscript on the phylesystem-api for Bioinformatics.
Thus to compile the phylesystem_writeup.tex, you'll need to download:
    http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/bioinformatics/for_authors/bioinfo01.zip
Unzipping the file in ~/texmf/tex/latex/local/ should be sufficient for LaTeX to find
stylesheets (I hope- it worked for MTH).

Emily Jane and MTH's iEvoBio 2014 presentations can be built using 
    bash build_presentations.sh
