\section{}
The Open Tree of Life project is creating a synthetic phylogeney, incorporating published phylogenies from across the tree of life.
We are using a git based datastore, mirror to github, to simulataneously track study curation and disseminate the phylogenies.


Key Points:
Pros
 - Versioned
 - Familiar to users
 - Comes with a lot of great machineray already enabled

diffing doesn't always behave well.
simple data structures behave oddly...

Meaningful merges
 -- immutable
 -- can't

Is this model applicable for database store

General model based decisions:
- Decisions that studies won't move.

- given the study ID what shard will it be in.

- scales better in general.

- Data is so open.
