nexml2json=1.0.0 to nexml2json=1.2.0
====================================

| v. 1.0       | v. 1.2             | parent    |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------|
| edge array   | edgeBySourceId obj | tree      |
| node array   | nodeByID obj       | tree      |
| otus array   | otusById obj       | nexml     |
| otu array    | otuById obj        | otusById  |
| tree array   | treeById obj       | treesById |
| trees array  | treesById obj      | nexml     |


For node, otus, otu, tree, and trees objects:
   @id=value pair in v1.0 is deleted n v1.2. The property's name is
its ID. edge object still hold their ID. 

Leaf node objects have a "^ot:isLeaf:true" in v1.0. In v1.2, the
can be quickly recognized by not being in edgeBySourceId, so
they lack ^ot:isLeaf

The tree will have a "^ot:rootNodeId" -> node ID string property

The nexml object will have ^ot:otusElementOrder and ^ot:treesElementOrder keys in v1.2
because the otusById and treesById are unsorted containers. The 
values of these will be an array of otusIds or treeIds.

The trees object will have a ^ot:treeElementOrder
